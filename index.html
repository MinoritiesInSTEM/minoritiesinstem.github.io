                <p>
                    Minorities in STEM was founded in 2024 at Woodward Academy to bridge the gap between minorities and STEM.
                    Acknowledging many initiatives to become more diverse and inclusive in the fields of robotics and technology,
                    it became its primary focus and vision for STEM to become more inclusive to everyone in our community of STEM.
                    To go from many initiatives separately to a whole network of people all over the world is the next step for us
                    to come together and encourage future generations by giving opportunities that would otherwise have been limited
                    to students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We support many initiatives such as facilitating conversation within our community while also bringing in guest
                    speakers and getting input from people in countless fields from all backgrounds to ensure an awesome experience
                    for everyone part of this organization. We are incredibly excited to start this organization and create a dent
                    in the ethnic disparities related to STEM fields. Even though this issue is widely recognized, few programs are
                    established when the time comes for students to choose what field they want to pursue. We hope to inspire and
                    encourage people in the minority to gain various opportunities as students. Our goal is not only to raise awareness
                    of the immense potential these students possess but also to help them see and believe in their own capabilities.

                <li>Reach out to an organization in your community and hold workshops</li>
                <li>Reach out to local professionals and ask them to come do a talk at your school after school and what projects they have done.</li>
                <li>Reach out to your robotics club or team and set up meetings with students from your school or schools from your community</li>

            <p>You would be giving students the confidence to pursue STEM as another opportunity that they can delve into creative fields that they would not have thought possible. We make STEM accessible for students at a young age while becoming engaged in a field we are passionate about and giving back to the community. Bridging the opportunity gap between students and allowing students to go beyond the textbook will be shaping their future and you being a part of it!</p>

        <h2>Creating a community with people in STEM to help each other go beyond the horizon</h2>
        
        <p>
            Building a community with students to professionals allows us to connect with each other when coming up with new ideas or insights. 
            Modeling after many other STEM organizations, having a network of like-minded individuals will boost potential that goes beyond the norm 
            by creating projects together while also finding people who are genuinely interested in your work. Holding events, talking to professionals, 
            and blogging all come down to creating a network and connecting to help with your personal initiatives. It is an incredible opportunity to advance 
            your own personal network and can even outreach to professionals for internships or have a 10-minute talk with peers about debates and issues in 
            your current STEM topic.
        </p>

        <p>
            By inviting students to a network of people like them, we get to immerse them into new opportunities before graduation from college with a whole 
            set of new options regarding STEM and be able to pursue new passions. Matching professionals with students gives students acts of empowerment and 
            independence to be able to connect with professional individuals and brings our community together.

                in and learn about different fields through our science and podcasts that they might not have access to online. With out network,
                students can ask questions and become more connected than ever before with the bloggers and professionals.
